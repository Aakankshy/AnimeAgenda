# AnimeAgenda
This is a simple react app that uses the Jikan API (an unofficial MyAnimeList API) to determine which seasonal or ongoing shows have or are going to release an episode on any given day. All you have to do to use it is open the website and click the **"What's on the Agenda?"** button.

## Getting Started
```
npm install
npm start
```
With the required modules downloaded, using the `npm start` command gets everything ready for development. The `App.jsx` file is in `src` while `index.html`, `main.css`, and the autogenerated `app.js` files are in `public`. On the inside, the code is just as simple as the site is on the outside. The way that the API is accessed is through the generation of links to JSON files on the Jikan API servers.

More details on the API itself and link format can be found on their [documentation](https://jikan.docs.apiary.io/#).
